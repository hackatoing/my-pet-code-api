## Local database

For local development it's deployed a **PostgreSQL** container with two databases, `development` and `test`.

Also, a **pgAdmin** dashboard can be used to access those database using http://localhost:5050. The credentials are as follow:
```
user: pgadmin@mypetcode.com
pass: pgadmin
```

The two databases are already configured, to access them just select from the left menu. The password for both is `postgres`.
